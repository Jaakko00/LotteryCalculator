# LotteryCalculator
A lottery application that calculates how much time it would take to win the lottery using your own lotterynumbers

## Description
Who wouldn't want to win the lottery, it would life changing after all. So i created an application that counts how many years it would approximately take to win the lottery! All you need to do is type in your own unique lotterynumbers and the application will tell you just how many years it would take to win.

## Features
You can choose that the app prints out the winning numbers everytime you play, after typing your own numbers of course.
The app can also keep repeating the calculations until it sees that you have won within a lifetime. These features can be switched on when starting the app by typing "true" when the application asks you about the feature in question.

## Classes
This repository includes 4 utility classes
#### Math
The Math class has a method for creating a random number between two given values
#### Arrays
The Arrays class has methods toIntArray, contains, containsSameValues, sort and printArray. I will most likely update this class with more methods as need be, more info about these methods under Index.html
#### MyConsole
The MyConsole class has method readInt which reads if the given input is an integer, and the readIntMinMax checks whether the given input is an integer between the given minimum and maximum values
#### Properties
The Properties class contains properties used in the Main class of LotteryCalculator. From here you can change the amount of lotterynumber slots available (default 7) and the biggest number you can have as a lotterynumber (default 40)
